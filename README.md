# TMF674_GeographicSite
TM Forum Open APIs (Apache 2.0) Geographic Site API

Covers the operations to manage (create, read, delete) sites that can be associated to a customer, account, service delivery or other entities. This API defines a Site as a convenience class that allows to easily refer to places important to other entities, where a geographic place is the  entity that can answer the question “where?”, allowing to determine where things are in relation to the earth's surface, and can be represented either in a textual structured way (geographic address) or as a geometry referred to a  spatial reference system (geographic location).
